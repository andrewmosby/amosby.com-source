<!-- Hello there. If you see these comments, you're probably interested in how the site was built. It's basically a SPA driven by vue.js and some simple query string routing. The header and footer as well as each 'page' is its own vue component with scoped js and css when necessary. Also, the resume page has two differnt components that are swapped out based on page view.

The site is still a bit of a work in progress and the following is just a list for me to remind myself what still needs to be done. Until then, enjoy the site!
-Images throughout copy sections and home page
-touch devices desktop fix for hover on menu
-go through copy (ask Brandon / Tim?)
-add Cardinal to projects -->
